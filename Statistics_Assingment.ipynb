    "# Types of Data:-\n",
    "# Data can be broadly categorized into two types: qualitative and quantitative.   \n",

    "# 1. Qualitative Data:\n",
    "# Description: Qualitative data is descriptive in nature and represents characteristics or qualities. It's often subjective and open-ended.   \n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples:\n",
    "# Customer feedback on a product: \"The product is easy to use and has a sleek design.\"   \n",
    "\n",
    "# Interview transcripts: \"I feel that the company culture is very supportive.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open-ended survey responses: \"What do you like most about this product?\"   \n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Quantitative Data:\n",
    "# Description: Quantitative data is numerical and measurable. It focuses on quantities and amounts.   \n",

    "# Examples:\n",
    "# Sales figures: $10,000 in monthly sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Age of respondents: 25 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Number of products sold: 50 units.\n",

    "# Scales of Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data can be further classified based on the level of measurement or scale:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Nominal Scale:\n",

    "# Examples:\n",
    "# Educational level (high school, college, graduate school)   \n",

    "# Customer satisfaction (very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Product ranking (1st, 2nd, 3rd)\n",

    "\n",
    "# 1. Mean\n",
    "# Definition: The mean, or average, is calculated by summing all the values in a dataset and dividing by the total number of values.   \n",
    "\n",
    "# When to use: The mean is appropriate for numerical data that is normally distributed (bell-shaped curve) and doesn't have significant outliers.\n",

    "\n",

    "# Example:\n",
    "# Using the same dataset as above, the median is 89.\n",

    "# Definition: The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset.   \n",

    "# Example:\n",
    "# In a survey about favorite colors, if \"blue\" is chosen by the most respondents, then \"blue\" is the mode.   \n",

    "# The choice of which measure to use depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the research question:\n",
